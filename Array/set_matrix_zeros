/*You are given a matrix 'MATRIX' of dimension 'N' x 'M'. Your task is to make all the elements of row 'i' and column 'j' equal to 0 if any element in the ith row or jth column of the matrix is 0.*/
//brute force solution:If there is a zero go across the entire row and column mark everything apart 0 as -1
//ones iteration is done, iterate ones again and mark all -1's as 0
//better solution: create a column array of m size and create a row array of n size initially mark everything as zero and now start itaration
//dont do anything if there is one when we find zero,mark the new array of row and column as 1
//ones iteration is done reiterate through the matrix if column array or row array or both are 1 then make element in original array as zero otherwise keep it as it is 
/* col[m]=0  row[n]=0
for(i=0;i<n;i++){
for(j=0->m){
if(arr[i][j]==0){
row[i]=1;
col[i]=1;
