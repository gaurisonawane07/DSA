//the problem is to minimize the maximum distance to gas stations 
//we have given array of n in sorted order, the numbers in array represent the coordinates of n different gas stations
//our task is to place k new gas stations such that we minimize the maximum distance between gas stations

//Brute force:
//take the gas stations which have highest as stations and place the new gas station between them at equal length
