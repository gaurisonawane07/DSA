/*Given a sorted array arr[] (with unique elements) and an integer k, find the index (0-based) of the largest element in arr[] that is greatyer than or equal to k. This element is called the "floor" of k. If such an element does not exist, return -1.*/
//smallest index such that arr[ind]>=n

//APPROACH
//using binary search take low pointer at index 0 and high at last index
